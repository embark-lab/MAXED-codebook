MAXED R21MH131787 (Phase 2: 2024- ) is being conducted at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and the University of Wisconsin-Madison and is a continuation of the MAXED study with a few protocol changes. 1.1 Specific Aims (MAXED): Driven exercise is a serious and common feature of eating disorders, but current understanding of factors that give rise to and maintain driven exercise is limited. Project MAXED aims to evaluate acute psychobiological response to a bout of moderate-intensity exercise among young females (age 14-22 years) with and without mild-to-moderate eating disorder symptoms. Overall, this study will contribute to the conceptualization of driven exercise and how individuals’ acute biological and affective responses to exercise contribute to risk for and maintenance of driven exercise. This pilot study has two primary aims: Aim 1: Confirm feasibility of paradigms evaluating acute response to exercise among outpatient individuals with mild-to-moderate eating disorder symptoms. We will confirm feasibility of our exercise-based tasks via a) study dropout at all timepoints, b) adverse events, c) completion rates of study tasks. Over the course of the study, we expect both eating disorder and healthy control groups to meet thresholds of &lt; 20% dropout, zero adverse events, and &gt; 80% task completion. Aim 2: Characterize variability in biobehavioral response to in-lab exercise among individuals with mild-to-moderate eating disorders. We will characterize changes during exercise in state body image, mood, and biological markers in both eating disorder and healthy control groups; we will specifically characterize mean levels of, and variability in, biobehavioral response to exercise across the groups. 1.2 Specific Aims (MAXED R21MH131787): This pilot R21 project will: 1) characterize variability in psychobiological response to in-lab moderate-intensity exercise among those with and without EDs; 2) create and refine exercise tasks that capture in-vivo exercise response; and 3) test the hypothesis that acute exercise response relates to DEx in those with EDs. Our sample will include 67 female subjects (aged 16-22y) with a restrictive-spectrum ED diagnosis (AN; atypical AN; AN-spectrum OSFED) who are medically cleared for moderate-intensity exercise, along with 33 age-matched healthy controls (HC). We will conduct a preliminary examination of multi-modal response (self-report, task-based learning, neurotransmitter shifts) to acute exercise using two novel tasks where subjects will: (Task 1) drink a high-calorie beverage prior to a self-paced bout of exercise to trigger threat and capture threat-reduction mechanisms of exercise, and (Task 2) engage in a prescribed, controlled bout of exercise to assess psychobiological exercise response. Aim 1: Internal validation of in-lab exercise tasks: characterize variability in psychobiological response to in-lab exercise across ED and HC. H1a: We expect improvements in both affect and body image during exercise, significant increases in cortisol, eCBs, BDNF, and significant decreases in leptin following moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, and no change in circulating biomarkers following the rest condition among those with EDs. H1b: Individuals with EDs will exhibit stronger biomarker, body image (+), and affective (+) response to exercise as compared to HCs. Exploratory: whether exercise impacts on learning differ across HC and ED. H1c: Acute exercise response will evidence greater variability among those with EDs compared to HC. Aim 2: External validation of in-lab acute exercise tasks: examine associations between acute exercise response and ED severity, self-reported DEx, and accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) across ED and HCs. H2: Findings will support concurrent validity of tasks. Acute exercise response will positively associate with ED severity and DEx among those with EDs, and positively associate with free-living MVPA across ED and HCs. Detailed explication of acute exercise effects among individuals with EDs in a controlled setting will (i) improve assessment of DEx risk and function among those with EDs, (ii) elucidate a testable model of DEx, and (iii) suggest targets for mechanistically informed DEx intervention "],["procedures.html", "Chapter 3 Procedures 3.1 Recruitment", " Chapter 3 Procedures The first wave of this study (MAXED) will include recruitment of 40 (20 control and 20 participants with ED symptoms) female adolescents and young adults aged 14-22. The second wave of this study (MR21) will include the recruitment of 100 (50 control and 50 participants with ED symptoms) female adolescents and young adults aged 16-22. 3.1 Recruitment Recruitment sources include: (1) University Health Services at UW-Madison and other area colleges and universities (2) flyers at area businesses (e.g. fitness centers, coffee shops) (3) local mental health providers, including providers within Wisconsin Psychiatric Institute and Clinic (WisPIC), as well as outside of the UW settings (e.g., at Community Mental Health Centers, private practices, etc.) (4) online advertisement on social media platforms (5) Personal recruitment by study staff, (6) campus e-mail recruitment. "],["interventions.html", "Chapter 4 Interventions 4.1 Screening Day stage 4.2 Day A, Day B, and Day C Stage", " Chapter 4 Interventions There are 2 stages to this protocol: 1) Screening Day with screening assessments; and 2) Day A, DayB, and Day C that consist of computational and exercise tasks, questionnaires, and blood draw. Participants will complete these two stages across 4 separate days. Day A, Day B, and Day C will occur randomly, spaced 6-8 days apart. 4.1 Screening Day stage During the Screening Day stage, participants will undergo a structured clinical interview to assess current eating disorder symptoms, psychological symptoms,cognitive function assessment, physical status, and demographics. If participants are under 18 years old, parents will also be asked to complete a demographics form. Participants will also complete the Approach Avoidance Conflict task. The assessment stage lasts 2-3 hours. 4.2 Day A, Day B, and Day C Stage During Day A, participants will complete two different tasks–Task 1: “Reward task” (rest condition) will include self-report measures, two blood draws immediately before and after completing 30 minutes of rest to examine changes in key neurotransmitters over time, and a post-rest behavioral task; and Task 2: “Threat task”(active condition) will include self-report of state emotional, body image, behavioral urges and cravings,a food challenge task of drinking a milkshake, and 30 minutes of exercise. During Day B, participants will complete Task 1: Reward (active condition), that includes self-report questionnaires, a behavioral task in which participants will work to earn “points” for exercise, and two blood draws, including one immediately before and one immediately after completing the 30 minutes of exercise to examine changes in key neurotransmitters. On Day C, participants will complete Task 2: Threat (rest condition),which will include completion of self-report questionnaires, a food challenge task, and 30 minutes of rest. Participants will provide four blood samples total during this study. In order to ensure that blood monoamine and hormone levels are controlled, participants will be asked to refrain from eating after1:00pm, only eating a provided nutritional supplement (nutrition bar) as a snack before attending Day A and Day B study visits at 4pm. Additionally, Task Day B will be scheduled during the follicular phase to control for possible menstrual phase effects on the biological response to exercise. Menstrual phase will be further clarified and controlled by the collection of blood samples on Task Day B to quantify estradiol levels. Participants will also complete a reinforcement learning task following Day A and Day B to examine the acute impact of exercise on reinforcement learning mechanisms. Day A, Day B, and Day C will each last about 2 hours. Lastly, participants will be provided with a fitness tracker to wear for 7 days between the screening visit and their second visit to objectively determine average levels of physical activity.

There are 24 items that contain 5 subscales which are avoidance and rule-driven behavior, weight control exercise, mood improvement, lack of exercise enjoyment, and exercise rigidity. Each statement is rated on a Likert scale of 1 (never true) to 5 (always true), and the score of each subscale is determined by averaging the items for that factor. Higher scores indicate greater pathology of excessive exercise. Scoring Scoring for the CET includes: 1. selects only variables that are relevant for the current measure Recode all variables (e.g. changing “never true = 1” to “never true = 0”), renamed necessary variables (e.g. cet_week_repeat to cet_week) Creates a symptom sum score, which gives a count of the number of compulsive exercise symptoms (0-5) that are present for each individual Key Variables cet_sum (defines the severity of compulsive exercise based on number of symptoms) All Variables 5.2 Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; Bernstein et al., 1994) is a 70-item questionnaire designed to measure multiple aspects of trauma in childhood. However, we have adapted this questionnaire to only include 28 items. Each item asks the individual to respond to a specific question following the prompt, “When I was growing up…”, and allows individuals to respond on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (“Never True”) to 5 (“Very Often True”). There are five sub-scales in this questionnaire: emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional neglect, and physical neglect. There were originally four, physical and emotional abuse were combined, but we chose to split them up for better accuracy. Each sub-scale is summed individually. High sub-scale scores indicate more childhood trauma in that sub-scale, and low scores indicate low childhood trauma in that sub-scale. Scoring 1. Selects only variables that are relevant for the current measure Recode all necessary variables (e.g. ‘Never true =1’ to ‘never true = 0’) Creates a symptom sum score, which gives a sum count of the number of symptoms (0-5) that are present for each individual Key Variables ctq_sum (defines sum score of symptoms) All Variables 5.3 Drive for Muscularity (DFM) The Drive for Muscularity Scale is a 15 item questionnaire that assesses the perceptions and behaviors surrounding the desire to gain muscles (McCreary &amp; Sasse, 2000). Questions are rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Always) to 6 (Never). The items are then reversed scored and higher sum scores indicating higher drive for muscularity. Scoring 1. Selects only variables that are relevant for the current measure Items are re-coded to be reversed coded (“1=5, 2=4, 3=3, 4=2, 5=1, 6=0”) Creates a symptom average score, which gives an average count of the number of symptoms (0-5) that are present for each individual Key Variables muscularity_average (defines sum score of symptoms) 5.4 Intolerance of Uncertainty (IUS) The IUS-S is a 12 item scale that Carleton et al. (2007) adapted from the original 27-item Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale from Freeston et al. (1994). It assesses the worry that an individual has about the possibility of negative events or outcomes, and there are two subscales that address anxious and avoidant aspects of the intolerance. Each item is scored using a 5-point Likert scale, and the scores are summed, with higher scores signifying a greater intolerance of uncertainty. Scoring 1. Selects only variables that are relevant for the current measure Recoded all necessary variables (e.g. changing “not at all characteristic of me = 1” to “not characteristic of me = 0”) Creates a symptom average score, which gives an average count of the number of symptoms (0-5) that are present for each individual Key Variables iuss_sum (defines average score of symptoms) 5.5 The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) assesses cognitive ability and is frequently used to screen for dementia and examine the severity and progression of cognitive impairment (Kurlowicz &amp; Wallace, 1999). The five categories measured are orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. There are 11 items on the examination, and the scores range from 0-30, with a score 23 or below signaling cognitive impairment. Scoring 1. selects only the variables that are relevant for the current measure Renames raw variables Key Variables mmse_total (sum of a participant’s score) 5.6 Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (BFNE) Leary (1983) shortened the Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (Watson &amp; Friend, 1969) to create the BFNE. It measures the tolerance to the possibility of judgment from others. There are 12 items that use a Likert scale (1 ‘Not at all’ to 5 ‘Extremely’) to rate how characteristic each statement is of the respondent. The items are summed to create a total score where higher scores indicate greater fear of negative evaluation. Scoring 1. Selects raw variables being used for the current measure Re-code variables to new variable names and values (e.g. ‘Not at all characteristic of me =1’ to ‘Not at all characteristic of me =0’) Sum the total scores Key Variables bfnes_sum 5.7 BIS/BAS Scale The Behavioral Activation System (BAS) and Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) scales were developed by Carver and White (1994) to assess how individuals respond to situations. Each statement is rated on a 4-point scale of how strongly one thinks that the statement applies to themselves. The BAS, which is the extent to which someone acts to gain rewards or positive outcomes, has three sub-scales: reward responsiveness, drive and fun seeking. There is one sub-scale for BIS, which is the extent to which someone acts to avoid negative outcomes. Scoring 1. Selects all relevant variables Adds variables bis_ambitious bis_all_out bis_act_now bis_no_hold get bas_drive. Adds variables bis_explore bis_fun bis_spontaneous bis_crave_excite to get bas_fun_seeking Adds variables bis_love_doing bis_excitement bis_opportunity_excite bis_positive_effect bis_excite_win to get bas_reward_responsiveness Adds variables bis_negative_event_fear bis_criticism bis_angry bis_worked_up bis_worry_poor_perform bis_no_fear bis_worry_for_mistake to get bis_sum Key Variables bis_sum bas_drive bas_fun_seeking bas_reward_responsiveness 5.8 The Body Image States Scale (BISS) The Body Image States Scale (BISS) is a six-item measure of individuals’ evaluation and affect about their physical appearance at a particular moment in time. They score from 0 (least impaired) to 8 (most impaired). Scoring 1. Selects raw variables being used for the current measure Renames variables to be easily identified Recode variables so that the least impaired = 0 and the most impaired = 8 Sum the total scores and rename this summary as biss_sum Key Variables biss_appearance_pre biss_body_size_pre biss_weight_pre biss_attractive_pre biss_looks_pre biss_average_looks_pre 5.9 The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) is an instrument measuring emotion regulation problems developed by K.L. Gratz and L. Roemer.The self-report scale is comprised of 36 items asking respondents how they relate to their emotions in order to produce scores on 6 different subscales.This tool can be especially useful in helping patients identify areas for growth in how they respond to their emotions, especially those with Borderline Personality Disorder, Generalised Anxiety Disorder or Substance Use Disorder. The DERS scale has been shown to have high internal consistency, good test–retest reliability, and adequate construct and predictive validity (Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2003). Scoring Key Variables 5.10 Eating Disorder Diagnostic scale (ED History) Eating Disorder Diagnostic scale, which is a 22-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure Anorexia nervosa, Bulimia nervosa, and Binge-eating disorder symptomatology aligned with the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. The scale is comprised of a combination of Likert ratings, dichotomous scores, behavioural frequency scores, and open-ended questions asking for weight and height. Scoring 1.

Its 39 items have an underlying nine-factor structure to demonstrate food cravings as well as restrictions. Scoring 1. Selects raw variables being used for the current measure Renames variables to be easily identified Recode variables so that “strongly disagree” = 0 and “strongly agree” = 4 Sum the total scores and rename this summary as fcq_sum Key Variables fcq_desire_restrict_pre fcq_desire_fast_pre fcq_desire_vomit_pre fcq_desire_laxatives_pre fcq_desire_exercise_pre fcq_desire_binge_pre 5.12 Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (FMPS) The Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (FMPS) is a 35 question self-report measure with four sub-scales of perfectionism. It contains a total of 35 items. These are subsumed to the following, originally six, now four subscales: Concern over mistakes and doubts about actions, Excessive concern with parents’ expectations and evaluation, Excessively high personal standards, Concern with precision, order and organisation. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert-style scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5= strongly agree) to describe how well each item describes the participant experiences. Scores are derived by summing responses across the questions included in each subscale. High scores on the Organization subscale do not contribute to Total Perfectionism and are not intrinsically problematic, but combined with high scores on the other factors may exacerbate dysfunction. Scoring 1. selects only the variables that are relevant for the current measure creates six additional variables based on sum scores reflecting six subscales of the questionnaire: m. It contains a total of 35 items. These are subsumed to the following, originally six, now four subscales: Concern over mistakes and doubts about actions, Excessive concern with parents’ expectations and evaluation, Excessively high personal standards, Concern with precision, order and organisation select only a few columns that will go into the final dataset Key Variables fmps_concerns_mistakes (reflects participant’s concern over mistakes and doubts about actions) fmps_concerns_parents_expectations (reflects participant’s excessive concern with parents’ expectations and evaluation) fmps_high_personal_standards (reflects participant’s excessively high personal standards) fmps_concerns_precision_order (reflects participant’s Concern with precision, order and organisation ) fmps_total_perfectionism_score (reflects participant’s total perfectionism scores) 5.13 Functions of Exercise Scale (FOE) The Functions of Exercise Scale was developed by Patricia Marten DiBartolo, Linda Lin, Simone Montoya, Heather Neal, and Carey Shaffer. The scale includes two subscales: Weight and Appearance (WA), and Health and Enjoyment (HE). The FES is a 16-item, self-report questionnaire that assesses motivation to exercise. Individuals provide ratings using a 7-item scale from “1 = do not agree” to “7 = strongly agree”. FES-HE scores are positively correlated with psychological well-being and physical health. Conversely, FES-WA scores are negatively correlated with depressive and eating disorder symptoms, self-esteem, and physical well-being. Scoring Key Variables 5.14 Menstrual Cycle Information (MCI) The Menstrual Cycle Information is a form of retrospective questionnaires (rating severity of symptoms from memory) that examines the participant’s menstrual information and secondary sexual characteristics. It consists 22 questions, including open-ended, yes-no, and Scoring 1. selects only the variables that are relevant for the current measure rename raw variables to appropraite names that are easy to understand recode old variables to make it consistent that no equals to zero in the scoresheet select only a few columns that will go into the final dataset Key Variables mci_estimate (assess whether participant can reliably estimate the stages of her cycle) mci_public_hair (reflects participant’s public hair development) mci_hysterectomy (assess whether participant has had a hysterectomy) 5.15 NVS Self-report The NVS Self-report states questionnaire consists three different parts: the first four questions measuring mental efforts, then six questions assessing body image states, and the last eighteen questions examining food craving intentions. Scoring 1. selects only the variables that are relevant for the current measure rename raw variables to appropraite names that are easy to understand creates three additional variables based on sum scores reflecting three components of the questionnaire: mental efforts, body image states, and food craving.

Spielberger. It can be used in clinical settings to diagnose anxiety and to distinguish it from depressive syndromes. Form Y, its most popular version, has 20 items for assessing trait anxiety and 20 for state anxiety. All items are rated on a 4-point scale, and higher scores indicate greater anxiety. Scoring Key Variables 5.18 Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale(YBOCS) The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale was developed by Wayne Goodman Dennis Charney, and is designed to rate the types of symptoms in patients with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and their severity. This rating scale is intended for use as a semi-structured interview. The interview should assess the items in the listed order and use the questions provided. The total score is usually computed from the subscales for obsessions (items 1-5) and compulsions (items 6-10). Scoring Key Variables 5.19 EMA Lab generated measures to assess eating disorder behaviors and cognitions both immediately before and after attending study visits.

Participants are presented with a series of choices between different options, each with varying levels of risk and reward. The task is designed to measure how participants weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of their choices, providing insight into their cognitive processes and risk preferences. 6.2 Work For Money Work For Money (WFM) is a behavioral task that assesses the relationship between effort and reward. Participants are asked to complete a series of tasks in exchange for monetary rewards. The task is designed to measure th e amount of effort participants are willing to exert for different levels of reward, providing insight into their motivation and decision-making processes. In the pilot of the study participants were asked to click the space bar a certain amount of times and they would earn $3 for the completion of the level. There were 10 of these levels, with each one gradually increasing the amount of times they need to hit the space bar. In the current version of the study, there are 6 levels, with participants earning $5 per level. 6.3 Work For Exercise Work For Exercise (WFE) is a behavioral task that assesses the relationship between effort and reward in the context of physical activity. Participants are asked to complete a series of exercise tasks in exchange for time to exercise in the later task . The task is designed to measure the amount of effort participants are willing to exert for different levels of reward, providing insight into their motivation and decision-making processes. In the pilot of the study participants were asked to click the space bar a certain amount of times and they were told they would add 3 minutes of exercise per completion of each level. There were 10 of these levels, with each one gradually increasing the amount of times they need to hit the space bar. In the current version of the study, there are 6 levels, with participants earning 5 minutes per level. 6.4 Inquist (PHASE 2) 6.4.1 Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task Participants have to select between an Easy and a Hard task. Both tasks involve pressing the space bar for a predetermined amount of time. The Hard task offers more money (in this script: 8 variable amounts) but is harder and takes twice as long. Participants make their selection knowingly under 3 different win probabilities (aka they might not win money even if they are successful; particularly not if the win probabilities are low). 6.4.2 Two-Step Decision This tasks replaced the Markov Task in the pilot version of the study. Two choice options A1 and A2 are available, which lead to two intermediate outcomes B1 and B2 at different probabilities. Intermediate outcomes B1 and B2 lead to rewards with different probabilities. Participants are instructed to try to earn as much treasure as they can. 6.5 Data Collection Form The Data collection form collects biological data (height and weight at first visit; blood pressure and heart rate at the beginning and end of the visit), physiological data (heart rate, RPM, distance and watts during exercise tasks; heart rate during rest task), and affect data in both the rest task and exercise task (Borg RPE and BISS scales). The Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale (BORG RPE) is a scale used to measure exertion from a scale of 6 (no exertion) to 20 (maximum effort). Participants are asked to rate their exertion every 5 minutes during both the exercise task and the rest task.
