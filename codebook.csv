This study is investigating the effects of persistent driven exercise in females aged 14-22 with and without eating disorders. Physical Activity is thought to change psychological and biological systems associated with reward and threat, which can lead to driven exercise in some people. We are investigating how biological and psychological systems are impacted by exercise. 
 
Participants in the study will come to the Psychiatry Department at the University of Wisconsin for three separate visits. During the first visit, we will go over a consent form that describes the study in more detail. You may ask as many questions as you like about the study.  If you decide to take part in the study and sign the consent form, we will complete a structured, clinical interview and a series of questionnaires. These interviews and questionnaires will ask questions about eating disorder symptoms you might have experienced and also ask about mental health and other behaviors. The purpose of this assessment is to determine eligibility for the study and to understand whether differences in health symptoms are related to certain cognitions and behaviors. This visit takes ~3 hours. Following this visit, you will be given an accelerometer to wear for 7 days to track your activity and sleeping patterns.  
 
You will be asked to complete three additional study visits following the initial intake if you are eligible for the study. 

On some study visit days, we will ask you to not eat from 1-4pm, and we will provide you with a nutritional supplement as a snack before your visit at 4pm, so that you feel energized and not hungry during your visit.  Tasks that you will be asked to do during some study visits include: 
1. completing  questionnaires about your mood and behaviors
2. taking part in a food challenge where you will be asked to drink a milk shake
3. Providing a sample of your blood via a blood draw
4. Exercising  or resting for ~30 minutes 
   
You will be compensated for your time participating. Your total compensation would be $200 over multiple visits if you complete all study procedures.  
 
You do not need to make a decision about joining the study right now. If you think you might be interested, we would like to ask you some questions today to see if you are eligible to begin the study. The questions will take about 5-10 minutes. We will ask you about your medical history, history of eating disorder symptoms, some psychological symptoms, HIV status, and demographic information.  You can stop answering questions at any time.  Choosing not to answer screening questions will not affect any treatment relationship you have with healthcare providers at UW-Madison, UW Health or any affiliated organizations, or any services you receive from them.   
 
If you are eligible to begin, we will make an appointment with you to meet with us at UW to tell you more information about the study and answer all of your questions.  At the time of the appointment or later, you can make a decision about whether you want to participate in the study or not. 
 
If you are eligible and decide to participate in the study, we will keep the information you provide during this screening along with the other information we collect during the study.  We will remove your name and contact information and label your information with a unique study code. Your name and contact information will be stored separately in a secured location with only study personnel having access to it so that we can contact you. We will ask your permission if you come into the study to keep your identifying information so that we can contact you for future studies, and we will destroy the identifying information after the study if you chose to not be contacted for future studies.

We are specifically interested in the biological markers endocannabinoids (eCB) and Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which are chemical signals in the body. We are doing this research because eating disorders represent a population with a higher mortality rate than other psychiatric disorders. Individuals with eating disorder use often use physical activity or driven exercise as a means to control things like fear of weight gain. Evidence has shown that engaging in driven exercise have an increased impairment and negatively impact treatment. Our goal is to better understand driven exercise in those with eating disorder and characterize differences in cognitive, affective, and biological response to exercise among adolescents and young adults with eating disorders. This research will provide more precisely targeted treatment for driven exercise, with considerable potential to improve outcomes associated with eating disorders. We also desire to make all deidentified data (which means data that is not connected to any of your personal information) collected from the study available to the public in order to be able to make data more accessible for research collaborations.

These sensors will simply measure the moisture on your skin. If completing virtually you will be monitored through your webcam while completing task. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The interview and cognitive testing will take about 3-4 hours.</span></p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;""><i>Accelerometer Procedures Leading up to Task Days (Required)</i> </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">To objectively track levels of physical activity throughout daily life, following this visit, you will be provided with an accelerometer device to wear for </span>7 days prior to your first task visit<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">. </span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You will return the accelerometer upon completing the first task visit. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The accelerometer is belt worn device similar to a matchbox-sized pedometer, and the data that we are collecting from the device is representing, in numbers, the device's acceleration (in units of gravity). We are interested in using these data to look at how an individual's general activity levels associate with response to exercise in the lab sessions. Devices do not have the capability to connect to Wi-Fi or GPS, so we are not collecting location data. The data from the accelerometer will be downloaded on a secure server with only study personnel having access to it. The accelerometer data will remain on the UW Dept. of Psychiatry secure server and will not be sent out to collaborators at other institutions. The unique study code linked to your accelerometer's data would be kept securely at UW.</span></p> <p>Task Days</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">On some study visit days, you will be asked to exercise at a moderate intensity for 30 mins. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">On some study visit days, you will be asked to drink a protein shake during the visit. </span></p> <p>Task Day A</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">On this day you will complete two ""task"", for the first task you will be asked to refrain from eating or drinking anything besides water after 1pm. We will provide you with a nutritional supplement as a snack at the beginning of your visit. If you are on prescription acute sedatives /pain killers (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids) or prescription stimulants (e.g., methylphenidate, amphetamines) to treat ADHD or other psychiatric conditions, you also be asked to refrain from using these for 24 hours prior to the lab sessions or 2 hours after the session. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A staff member will collect a sample of your blood for analysis to look at, which will amount to around 2 teaspoons of blood. You will be asked to answer some self-report question about your thoughts and feelings in the present moment. You will be asked complete two computer tasks during the visit.</span></p> <p>Task Day B<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">On this day, you will be asked to refrain from eating or drinking anything besides water after 1pm. We will provide you with a nutritional supplement as a snack at the beginning of your visit. If you are on prescription acute sedatives / pain killers (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids) or prescription stimulants (e.g., methylphenidate, amphetamines) to treat ADHD or other psychiatric conditions, you also be asked to refrain from using these for 24 hours prior to the lab sessions or 2 hours after the session. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">During this visit, you will be asked to complete some self- reported questionnaires asking about your mood, thoughts, behaviors, and motivation. The questionnaires can contain sensitive questions that can evoke negative emotions. You may skip any question on the questionnaires that you do not wish to answer. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A staff member will collect a sample of your blood for analysis to look at, which will amount to around 2 teaspoons of blood. You will then be asked complete two computer tasks during the visit.</span></p> <p>Task Day C<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">During this visit, you will be asked to complete some self- reported questionnaires asking about your mood, thoughts, behaviors, and motivation. The questionnaires can contain sensitive questions that can evoke negative emotions. You may skip any question on the questionnaires that you do not wish to answer. After questionnaires you will again be asked to answer some selfreport question about your thoughts and feelings in the present moment. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The order of task day (A,B, and C) will be randomly chosen, like flipping a coin. Random means that study staff will have no control over which task day you will do first, second, and last. The decision of which order you will complete the task days will be made by a computergenerated program.</span></p> <p>Each task day should take 2 hours to complete</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>Blood Sample</i> </span></span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A staff member will collect a sample of your blood (about 2 teaspoons) at two different timepoints. Your samples will be stored frozen in a locked room in WisPIC at the Health Emotions Research Institute. The samples will be used to measure levels of certain chemicals (BDNF, leptin, serotonin, and endocannabinoids) in your bloodstream. We will also perform genetic testing, which is done on your DNA. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, carries the genetic instructions for the cells that make up your body. Genes tell your body how to do things like form your spine, or what color your eyes should be. Any remaining blood samples may be combined with samples from other larger future studies to look at the relationship between various biomarkers and behavior. In order to protect your privacy, the labels on these samples will not have any information that directly identifies you, but they will be labeled with a number that can be linked to you. The information that links you to the sample will be kept in the locked and secured office of the PI or designated research staff. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You may request that your sample be destroyed at any time, by calling the EMBARK Lab at 608-572-7452. However, even if the sample is destroyed, any information from tests that were done before this time can be used.</span></p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>Aerobic Exercise</i> </span></span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Participants will be asked to ride on a stationary bike for 30 minutes at their own intensity or rest for 30 minutes. You will be given a heart rate monitor so study staff can assess your heart rate while you exercise. Once your heart rate reaches a certain percentage of your maximum heart rate (~70-75% maximum heart rate), you will be asked to continue at that level of effort. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Whether you will be in the exercise or rest group will not be your choice; condition assignment will be randomized such that each participant has a 50% chance of being assigned to either exercise or rest. At various times throughout exercising, research staff will measure your heart rate and ask you to rate how intense your physical activity feels. A staff member will be monitoring you to make sure that you are physically safe and comfortable.</span></p> <p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>Cognitive tasks</i> </span></span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">After exercising at each visit, you will complete a cognitive task. You will be provided instructions for the task before the task begins. Basically, your job during the task is to win as many fake coins as possible by using left and right arrow keys to choose one of two 'magic carpets' to navigate to one of two mountains displayed on the screen. Upon arriving at the mountain, you will have to choose between a left or right lamp, one of which results in receiving a coin. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In addition to this first task, you will also be asked to complete two other tasks where basically your job during the first task is to win as many real coins (these coins will translate into real money) as possible by using the space bar. You will be provided instructions for the task before the task begins. The second task you will be winning exercise time by using the space bar. Again, more instructions for the task will be provided before you begin the task.</span></p> <p>Audio Recording</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As part of the study we will collect audio recording during your intake and study visits. The audio recording is being collected for reliability checks only (to make sure the study team is being consistent between each participant). Recordings will be kept till the end of the study and destroyed following completion of the study. Recordings will not be used for purposes outside of the study or in any papers or publications.</span></p> <p>How we will use your protected health information (PHI)</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Protected health information, also called PHI, is information about your physical or mental health that includes your name or other information that can identify you, like your date of birth. To do this study, we will use the following kinds of PHI:</span></p> <ul> <li style=""tab-stops: list .5in;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Results of tests or procedures done as part of the study</span></li> <li style=""tab-stops: list .5in;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Things you tell the researchers about your health</span></li> </ul> <p>How long will I be in this study?</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You will be part of the study for about one month, which will consist of three visits. How long you are in the study depends only on when we are able to schedule your task visits. We hope to schedule the task visits within one month of the initial visit, but based on your schedule and availability, this might be up to 90 days later. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The researchers may take you out of the study, even if you want to continue, if you do not follow the study rules or no longer meet the requirements to be in the study.</span></p> <p>Do I have to be in the study? What if I say ""yes"" now and change my mind later?</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">No, you do not have to be in this study. Taking part in research is voluntary. This means that you decide if you want to be in the study. If you decide now to take part, you can choose to leave the study at any time.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you decide to be in the study, the researchers will tell you about new information or changes in the study that may affect your willingness to continue in the study. Let the researchers know if you choose to leave the study.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you decide not to take part in the study, or if you choose to leave the study, your choice will not affect any treatment relationship you have with healthcare providers at UWMadison, UW Health or any affiliated organizations, or any services you receive from them. No matter what decision you make, and even if your decision changes, there will be no penalty to you. You will not lose medical care or any legal rights.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Your authorization for researchers to use your protected health information (PHI) does not have an end date. Authorizing the research team to use your PHI means that we can release it to the people or groups listed in this form for the purposes described in this form. Once data has been anonymized and uploaded/shared with other researchers, we cannot retroactively go back and remove your data from the larger dataset. However:</span></p> <ul> <li style=""tab-stops: list .5in;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You can choose to take back your authorization for researchers to use your health information. You can do this at any time before or during your participation in the research.</span></li> <li style=""tab-stops: list .5in;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you take back your authorization, information that was already collected may still be used and shared with others, but the researchers will no longer be able to collect NEW information about you.</span></li> <li style=""tab-stops: list .5in;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you take back your authorization, you will not be able to take part in the research study. </span></li> </ul> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">To take back your authorization, you will need to tell the researchers by writing to the Lead Researcher:</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Dr. Katherine Schaumberg Department of Psychiatry University of Wisconsin 6001 Research Park Blvd Madison, WI 53719</span></p> <p>Will I receive the results of research tests?</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">All of the tests that are part of this study are for research purposes only. Because of this, we will not tell you or your doctors the results of these research tests. We may have to tell appropriate authorities, such as child protective services or health care providers, if we learn during the study that you or others are at risk of harm (for example, due to child or elder abuse, or suicidal thoughts).</span></p> <p>What are the risks?</p> <p>Interview and Questionnaires:<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> The risk of completing psychological interviews and written tests may include fatigue and the feeling of unpleasant emotions. You can refuse to answer any of the questions you do not want to answer. You can take breaks if you want to. The interviewer will check with you at the end of the testing to see if you are anxious or distressed. If you are feeling especially uneasy about the questions, Dr. Schaumberg will be available to speak with you if you would like.</span></p> <p>Confidentiality: <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This study involves asking questions about mental health symptoms. There is a chance that someone outside of the study could find out about the answers to your questions during our interview. If that happens, this could expose you to legal risks or damage your reputation, which could also affect your relationships with family and friends, affect your employment, or make it harder to get insurance or a job. We will try to keep others from getting this information by keeping your name and identifying information separate from your answers and data, keeping all records and study materials under lock, and allowing only limited access to the information within our study team. The study is protected by a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This means that even if the police or courts ask to look at the data we have collected, we will not share any information that would identify you as a participant in the study.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Furthermore, any data made publicly available (or shared with other researchers by request/application) will be deidentified-which means that it will be made so that it cannot be linked to you in anyway as much as possible. It is impossible to guarantee that your data will never be linked back to you, but through extensive deidentification making your data available to the public will involve only the minimal amount of harm or risk that is possible to you. Due to the nature of open data sharing, it is impossible to guarantee that data will not be reidentified or linked back to you personally or to estimate the likelihood that this will happen. Rather, we will take all steps in our power to minimize this risk to you as a participant. These steps will include removing identifiers such as names and birthdates, compiling data into groups not defined by participants, etc. If any of your demographic or other information puts you at risk for being identified based off where your live or the population you are a part of, additional steps will be taken to ensure this information is not enough to tie the data back to you. If you would like to participate in the study but are concerned about the public nature of the data, you can opt out of having your data made publicly available while still participating in the study. In this instance, your data will be viewed only by the researchers, and will not be included in the dataset that will be made available to the public. </span></p> <p>Blood sample and analysis: <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Possible risks associated with the blood sample include discomfort, bleeding, and in rare cases, infection. To safeguard the privacy of your blood sample, all samples are de-identified (labeled with a random code and not your name) with only the study team having access to the code. There may be other risks related to genetic testing that we don't know about right now. This is because the field of genetics is moving forward very quickly.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 is a Federal law that is supposed to prevent health insurance companies and employers from discriminating against people based on genetic information. There are some limits to this law:</span></p> <ul> <li style=""tab-stops: list .5in;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It does not apply to businesses that employ fewer than 15 people. So, if you work somewhere with fewer than 15 employees, your employer could fire you or make other decisions about employment using genetic information.</span></li> <li style=""tab-stops: list .5in;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Regardless of where you work, it does not apply to life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.</span></li> <li style=""tab-stops: list .5in;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This means that if you had an abnormal genetic test result, and that result became known, then you could be denied or pay higher rates for life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.</span></li> </ul> <p>Cardiac event related to exercise:<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> Physical activity can suddenly and briefly increase the risk of sudden cardiac death and acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in prone persons. Individuals at increased risk for cardiovascular events (e.g. prior experiences with chest pain during exercise, history of heart disease, untreated high blood pressure) are not eligible to participate in the study. Throughout the exercise intervention, research personnel will monitor heart rate through a heart rate monitor strapped to the chest while observing your behavior and exertion. You are encouraged to communicate discomfort/pain, and you can terminate the task at any time without penalty. If alarming signs appear (e. chest pain, radiating pains, exhaustion) you may be asked to stop. If unexpected, non-emergency physiological problems appear, research personnel will call an on-call study physician. If necessary, research personnel will call 911 to transport you to a local hospital.</span></p> <p>Other risks related to exercise:<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> Participation in any physical activity or exercise can involve risk. These risks might include fatigue, dizziness, nausea, shortness of breath, low blood sugar, chest pain, exhaustion, or muscle soreness. Sometimes, exercise can involve more severe physical problems, such as bone fracture, joint damage, hospitalization, or even death. Generally, more severe risks of participating in exercise are related to the presence of known or unknown cardiovascular, pulmonary, or metabolic diseases. The risk of cardiac events is higher in older adults than young adults (18-24 years). We have certain procedures in place to identify the presence, signs, symptoms, and/or risk factors of such diseases in subjects, and we hope that you feel comfortable communicating any discomfort and pain related to these procedures.</span></p> <p>Withholding Benzodiazepines and/or prescription stimulants.<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> Possible withdrawal symptoms include increased anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, body aches, and a general feeling of unhappiness. Participants are advised to talk with their healthcare provider and determine if withholding medication is acceptable and safe before entering the study. Participants will be told of the possible withdrawal symptoms above and advised to contact their physician or 911 in the event of an emergency if any symptoms appear.</span></p> <p>Will being in this study help me in any way?<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Taking part in this research is not expected to benefit you personally.

Actual Attempt:
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent
does not have to be 100%. If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt. 
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred",radio,"Have you made a suicide attempt?","0, no | 1, yes",,,,,,,,,,,,
